-   **Short and Long Breaks**: Alternates between short and long breaks after a set number of cycles.
-   **Visual Timer**: Real-time countdown displayed on the UI.
-   **Session Tracking**: Displays completed work sessions with checkmarks.
-   **Start and Reset**: Easy-to-use buttons for starting and resetting the timer.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
2. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the game.

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Use the `Start` button to begin the timer.
2. Follow the work and break cycles as guided by the timer.
3. Use the `Reset` button to reset the timer and cycle counts.

## Pomodoro Technique Overview

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. It involves:

1. Working for a fixed interval (typically 25 minutes).
2. Taking a short break (e.g., 5 minutes).
3. After completing four work intervals, taking a longer break (e.g., 20 minutes).

This timer simplifies the process, guiding users through these intervals seamlessly.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x installed on your machine.
-   Tkinter library (comes pre-installed with Python on most systems).
