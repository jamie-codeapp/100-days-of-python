# Password Generator

This is a Python-based password generator that creates a secure, randomized password with a user-specified number of letters, symbols, and numbers.

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to input the number of:

-   Letters they want in the password.
-   Symbols they want in the password.
-   Numbers they want in the password.

2. The script randomly selects characters from predefined lists of letters, symbols, and numbers.
3. It then shuffles the selected characters and combines them into a final password.
4. The password is displayed to the user.

## How to Run

To generate a password, ensure that Python is installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory where main.py is located.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

4. The script will prompt you to input:

-   The number of letters.
-   The number of symbols.
-   The number of numbers.

5. The script will then generate and display a random password, combining the specified number of letters, symbols, and numbers.

## Example
