# Band Name Generator

This is a simple Python script that helps users generate a fun band name by combining the name of the city they grew up in with their pet's name.

## How It Works

1. The script prompts the user for the name of the city they grew up in.
2. It then asks for the name of their pet.
3. Finally, it combines these two inputs to suggest a potential band name.

## How to Run

To run the script, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory where main.py is located.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

4. The script will ask you two questions:

-   "What's the name of the city you grew up in?"
-   "What's your pet's name?"

5. After providing your answers, the script will output your custom band name.

## Example

What's your pet's name?

```
