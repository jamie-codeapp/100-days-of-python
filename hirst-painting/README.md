# Hirst Painting

This project generates a grid of colorful dots using Python's turtle graphics library. It draws a 10x10 grid of circles, each with a random color chosen from a predefined list, resulting in a fun, artistic pattern.

## Features

-   **Random Color Selection**: Each dot in the grid has a randomly assigned color.
-   **Customizable Color List**: You can modify the color palette by changing the colors in `COLOR_LIST`.
-   **Grid of Dots**: The turtle draws a grid layout, making it easy to experiment with different patterns and grid sizes.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Download or clone the repository.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `main.py`.
4. Run the following command:

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

5. A `turtle` graphics window will open, and youâ€™ll see a colorful grid being drawn automatically.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x
-   `turtle` graphics library (usually included with Python)
