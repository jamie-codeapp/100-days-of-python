# Calculator

This is a simple command-line calculator program built in Python. It supports basic arithmetic operationsâ€”addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program features continuous calculation mode and clears the terminal between new calculations.

## How It Works

1. The program displays an ASCII art logo.
2. The user is prompted to input a number and select an arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
3. After inputting the second number, the program calculates the result.
4. The user can either:
    - Continue calculating with the current result, or
    - Start a new calculation from scratch.
5. The process repeats until the user decides to exit.

## Features

-   Performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
-   Allows continuous calculations using the result of previous operations.
-   Displays a custom ASCII art logo.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Download or clone the repository.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `main.py` and `art.py`.
4. Run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

5. Follow the prompts to input numbers and select operations:
    - You will be asked to enter the first number.
    - Pick an arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
    - Enter the second number.
    - The result will be displayed.
    - You can continue calculating with the result or start a new calculation.

What's the first number?:
> 10

Pick an operation:
> +
What's the next number?:
> 5

10 + 5 = 15

Type 'y' to continue calculating with 15, or type 'n' to start a new calculation:
> n
```

## Files

1. `main.py` - This file implements a simple calculator that:
    - Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
    - Displays the logo from art.py.
    - Allows continuous calculations using previous results.
    - Clears the terminal between calculations.
2. `art.py` - Contains the ASCII art logo displayed at the start of the program.

## Requirements

Python 3.x
