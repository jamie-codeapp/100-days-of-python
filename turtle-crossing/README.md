# Turtle Crossing Game

The Turtle Crossing Game is a simple Python game built using the `turtle` module. In this game, the player controls a turtle that must avoid oncoming cars by moving upwards on the screen. The objective is to reach the top of the screen without colliding with any cars. The game includes a scoring system that increases the level after each successful crossing, and the speed of the cars increases with each level.
