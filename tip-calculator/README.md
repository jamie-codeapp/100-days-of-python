# Tip Calculator

This is a simple Python script that calculates how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including a tip.

## How It Works

1. The script asks the user to input the total bill amount.
2. It then prompts for the desired tip percentage (10%, 12%, or 15%).
3. The user enters how many people will split the bill.
4. Finally, the script calculates the amount each person should pay, including the tip, and rounds it to two decimal places.

## How to Run

To run the script, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory where main.py is located.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

4. The script will prompt you to enter:

-   The total bill amount.
-   The tip percentage (10, 12, or 15).
-   The number of people splitting the bill.

5. After providing the inputs, the script will output how much each person should pay.

## Example

How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
